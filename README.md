This is a refactoring of an old tarot web app (jQuery and PHP ... it was 2015) with artwork by the early Renaissance master Giotto.  Built on Next.js (React web framework), PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM.  Material-UI and Framer Motion provided the theming and animations.  Users enter questions and receive three tarot cards with explanations on the next page.  Prisma/PostgreSQL allow the user to save previous questions and readings.
